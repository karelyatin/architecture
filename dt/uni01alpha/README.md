# Deployed Topology - Alpha

If you are looking for information on how to deploy the alpha based DT, then
please the [README](../../examples/dt/uni01alpha/README.md) in the examples
directory.

This directory `dt/uni01alpha/`, exists so that the
[kustomization.yaml](../../examples/dt/uni01alpha/kustomization.yaml) in
the examples directory of uni01alpha topology, reference it by path as a
component. It's contents are likely uninteresting unless you want to understand
how kustomize was implemented in this repository.
