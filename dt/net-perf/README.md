# VA: Networking Perf

If you are looking for information on how to deploy the Networking Perf VA, then
please see the
[Net_Perf README in the examples directory](../../../examples/dt/net-perf/README.md).

This directory, `architecture/dt/net-perf/`, exists so that the
[kustomization.yaml](../../../examples/dt/net-perf/kustomization.yaml)
in the examples directory for the Networking Perf VA, reference it by path as a
component. Its contents are likely uninteresting unless you want to
understand how kustomize was implemented in this repository.
